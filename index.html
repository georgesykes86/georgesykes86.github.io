						<p id="hidden">Disclaimer: Sorry for the gratuitous insertion of a holiday photo but felt I had to put them to some use!<br />Having spent the last 6 years of my life working as a Mechanical Engineer and Innovation Consultant, I have been constantly trying to develop new technologies and new products. I have seen the way digital technologies are taking over all aspects of our lives and I want to be part of that revolution. I am really excited about taking on this new challenge and I would love for it to be as part of the Founders and Coders community.</p>
